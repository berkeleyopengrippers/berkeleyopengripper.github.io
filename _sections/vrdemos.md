A Virtual Reality system was developed using the HTC Vive and interfaced with our robot over ethernet. We developed an inverse dynamics solver that translates the 6-DoF controller pose to a 7-DoF robot pose that prioritizes 'elbows out'.
We found two-armed teleoperation to be extremely difficult to coordinate.

## Coffee & Cleaning

Our operator demonstrates the ability to make coffee using the telepresense system. This is a difficult task for a robot to accomplish becauise there are small targets (such as the 'on' button), deformable objects (such as the paper cup), fine movements (loading the machine), and liquids (pouring the coffee). The robot spills a little in the process and then shows its ability to clean up a mess afterwards.

This video demonstrates the accuracy and stability of the system while operated remotely. Here we pick screws off a flat surface and place them into a storage container. The screws are M5 cap heads (5mm in diameter, 20mm long).

## Payload Demonstration

Blue has the ability to hold over 2kg at arms-length. Closer to its body, the robot's payload increases. Note (at the end of the video) when the robot drops the 5lb weight on the the hand of the robot!
